<h3>Number One: Battleship</h3>
<p>
    I watched this movie since so long ago. Maybe because it's kinda childhood memory..? <br />
    As I said, this is my ranking.

<h3>Number Two: Tomorrow I Will Date With Yesterdayâ€™s You</h3>
<p>
    I stumbled on this movie from my friend recommending. Surprisingly good. A touching (bitter) love story.<br />
    It's been really a while that I got tear welling up my eyes from watching movies...
</p>
<h3>Number Three: Spider Man: Across the spider verse</h3>
<p>
    I got to watch this movie while on boarding the plane travelling to Japan.<br />
    The art design and music composing are out of this world! Very pleasing experience!
